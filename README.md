# OD-Lens (Lite)
Simple calculation of the basic optical parameters of a lens. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for optical engineers, photographers, and students to explore the relationships between focal length, field of view, sensor size, and aperture.
The user selects which parameter they want to calculate, and the program automatically computes it using the provided values. Parameters are recalculated instantly as you type, providing immediate feedback.
